# GameOverlayProxy
Steam Game Overlay Proxy DLL (patched)

This is a Counter Strike: Global Offensive cheat written as a Proxy dll to inject into the game. The cheat uses arduino for moving mouse as this used to be used on several kernel Anti-Cheats a long time ago, and back then had little arduino/2nd mouse movement detection.
