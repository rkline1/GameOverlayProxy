# GameOverlayProxy
Steam Game Overlay Proxy DLL (patched)

This is a Counter Strike: Global Offensive cheat written as a Proxy dll to inject into the game. The cheat uses arduino for moving mouse as this used to be used on several kernel Anti-Cheats a long time ago, and back then had little arduino/2nd mouse movement detection. 

HOW IT WORKED

1. You would replace the original steam overlay dll with this one. 
2. Rename original overlay file to GameOverlayRenderer64.dll 
3. Run csgo and the cheat will automatically be injected using steam's overlay.

This has since been patched by valve.
